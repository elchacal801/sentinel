### ✅ 2. Attack Path Analyzer

**File Created:** `backend/services/analytics/attack_paths.py` (450+ lines)

**AttackPathAnalyzer Class:**

Analyzes potential attack paths in the knowledge graph with sophisticated metrics:

**Path Metrics Calculated:**

**1. Likelihood (0-1)**
```python
likelihood = base_likelihood × path_length_factor × 
             exploit_factor × security_controls_factor
```
- Decreases with path length (more steps = more failure points)
- Factors in exploit difficulty
- Considers security controls (WAF, MFA, EDR)

**2. Difficulty (0-10)**
- Based on required attacker skill
- Path length complexity
- Exploit availability
- Relationship traversal difficulty

**3. Detectability (0-1)**
- Probability of detection
- Increases with path length (more activity = more noise)
- Factors in monitoring/logging
- Higher is better for defense

**4. Impact (0-10)**
- Based on target asset criticality
- Bonus for paths reaching multiple critical assets
- Determines damage if exploited

**5. Skill Level Required**
- Expert (difficulty >= 8.0)
- High (difficulty >= 6.0)
- Medium (difficulty >= 3.0)
- Low (difficulty < 3.0)

**6. Time Estimate**
- Estimates exploitation time based on difficulty and path length
- Ranges from "< 1 hour" to "months"

**Key Features:**

**Path Viability Assessment:**
- Determines if path is realistically exploitable
- Viable if likelihood > 0.1 and difficulty < 9.5

**Risk Calculation:**
```python
path_risk = likelihood × impact × (1 - detectability)
```

**Critical Node Identification:**
- Identifies chokepoints (nodes appearing in multiple paths)
- Calculates criticality scores
- Recommends which nodes to prioritize for hardening

**Path Ranking:**
- Sorts paths by overall risk
- Provides top N most dangerous paths

**Mitigation Recommendations:**
- Path-specific defensive measures
- Detection time windows
- Network segmentation suggestions
- Monitoring improvements

- Calculates trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Computes velocity (rate of change)
- Generates forecasts for N days ahead
- Identifies patterns (spikes, cycles)

**2. Anomaly Detection**
- Statistical analysis of event timelines
- Z-score calculation for outliers
- Configurable threshold (default: 2.0 standard deviations)
- Identifies spikes and drops
- Severity classification (critical/high/medium)

**3. Attack Likelihood Prediction**
Predicts probability of asset being attacked based on:

**Factors Analyzed:**
- **Asset Exposure** (0-1)
  - Internet-facing: 1.0
  - DMZ: 0.7
  - Internal: 0.3

  - Based on active campaigns
  - Exploitation activity

- **Historical Targeting** (0-1)
  - Past attacks on this asset
  - Targeted industry patterns

- **Vulnerability Count**
  - Normalized to 0-1 scale

**Weighted Likelihood:**
```python
likelihood = 
  exposure × 0.25 +
  criticality × 0.15 +
  threat_landscape × 0.30 +
  historical_targeting × 0.20 +
  vulnerabilities × 0.10
```

**Predicted Timeframes:**
- within_days (likelihood >= 0.8)
- within_weeks (likelihood >= 0.6)
- within_months (likelihood >= 0.4)
- beyond_quarter (likelihood < 0.4)

**4. Emerging Threat Identification**

× Threat intel: 2.5 (active exploitation)
× Exposure: 1.5 (internet-facing)
× Age: 1.4 (< 7 days)
× Targeting: 2.0 (campaign targeting org)

= 7.5 × 1.5 × 2.0 × 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.4 × 2.0
= 787.5 (capped at 10.0)

Final Risk: 10.0 (CRITICAL)
```

detectability = 0.35  # 35% chance of detection
impact = 10.0  # Critical database
skill_required = "medium"
time_estimate = "3 hours"

# Risk Calculation
path_risk = 0.72 × 10.0 × (1 - 0.35) = 4.68

overall_risk = 9.3 (CRITICAL)

    "🚨 HIGH LIKELIHOOD: This attack path is highly exploitable - immediate action required",
    "⚠️ HIGH IMPACT: Target is critical asset - prioritize protection",
    "👁️ LOW DETECTABILITY: Implement monitoring and logging along this path",
    "Short attack path - implement defense in depth",
    "Estimated exploitation time: 3 hours - ensure detection within this window",
    "Consider network segmentation to break attack path"
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 3: Predictive Analytics

**Emerging Threat Detection:**

**Input:**

vulns = 0.5  # 5 vulnerabilities

likelihood = 
  1.0 × 0.25 +
  0.7 × 0.15 +
  0.65 × 0.30 +
  0.2 × 0.20 +
  0.5 × 0.10
