# PHASE 3 COMPLETION REPORT

**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO  
**Date:** 2025-10-01  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 (Knowledge Graph & Fusion) of the Sentinel Intelligence Platform has been successfully completed. The system now features a fully operational Neo4j knowledge graph with multi-source intelligence correlation and IC-standard confidence scoring.

## Deliverables Completed

### ✅ 1. Neo4j Graph Integration

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/workers/tasks.py` - Added graph storage functions

**Storage Functions Implemented:**
- `store_assets_in_graph()` - Persists discovered assets with full relationship mapping
- `store_vulnerabilities_in_graph()` - Links vulnerabilities to assets in graph

**What Changed:**
- All collection workers now automatically persist data to Neo4j
- Domain → Subdomain → IP relationships created
- Asset → Vulnerability relationships established
- Temporal metadata tracked (discovered, last_seen)

**Graph Schema:**
```
(Domain:Asset)-[:PART_OF]-(Subdomain:Asset)-[:RESOLVES_TO]-(IP:Asset)
                    ↓
           [:HAS_VULNERABILITY]
                    ↓
            (Vulnerability)
```

### ✅ 2. Multi-INT Fusion Service

**Files Created:**
- `backend/services/fusion/__init__.py`
- `backend/services/fusion/correlator.py` (600+ lines)

**MultiINTCorrelator Class:**
Implements intelligence correlation across multiple disciplines:

1. **IOC Correlation**
   - Groups same indicators across sources
   - Calculates occurrence count
   - Extracts threat actors and malware families
   - Returns high-confidence assessments

2. **Vulnerability-Threat Correlation**
   - Links CVEs to active threat intelligence
   - Identifies exploitation in the wild
   - Calculates risk multipliers
   - Provides urgent/priority recommendations

3. **Temporal Correlation**
   - Finds events within time windows
   - Identifies coordinated activity
   - Clusters related events
   - Detects campaign patterns

4. **Spatial Correlation**
   - Groups entities by geography
   - Identifies infrastructure clustering
   - Regional targeting analysis
   - Location-based patterns

5. **Campaign Identification**
   - Combines IOC + temporal + behavioral patterns
   - Detects coordinated threat campaigns
   - High-confidence campaign assessments
   - Attribution support

### ✅ 3. Confidence Scoring

**ConfidenceScorer Class:**
Implements IC-standard confidence calculation:

**Source Confidence Levels:**
```python
OSINT:   0.7  # Open source - verifiable but may be stale
SIGINT:  0.85 # Signals - technical, hard to spoof
CYBINT:  0.9  # Cyber - technical, verifiable
GEOINT:  0.8  # Geographic - visual, verifiable
HUMINT:  0.6  # Human - valuable but subjective
```

**Multi-Source Boost:**
- Independent sources increase confidence
- Different source types boost more than same type
- Diversity bonus for multiple INT types

**Temporal Decay:**
- Fresh intelligence = higher confidence
- Age causes exponential confidence decay
- Configurable decay threshold

**IC-Standard Labels:**
```python
High:     0.8 - 1.0  # Strong corroboration
Moderate: 0.5 - 0.8  # Some corroboration
Low:      0.2 - 0.5  # Limited evidence
Minimal:  0.0 - 0.2  # Speculation
```

### ✅ 4. Graph-Powered API Routes

- `backend/api/routes/assets.py` - Neo4j integration

## Intelligence Fusion Examples

### Example 1: IOC Correlation

**Input:**
```json
[
  {"ioc": "1.2.3.4", "source": "osint", "threat_actor": "APT99"},
  {"ioc": "1.2.3.4", "source": "cybint", "malware": "Backdoor.X"},
  {"ioc": "1.2.3.4", "source": "sigint", "observed": "2025-10-01"}
]
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "ioc_value": "1.2.3.4",
  "occurrence_count": 3,
  "sources": ["osint", "cybint", "sigint"],
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "confidence_label": "high",
  "threat_actors": ["APT99"],
  "malware_families": ["Backdoor.X"],
  "assessment": "High-confidence threat infrastructure"
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- 3 independent sources
- 3 different INT types (max diversity)
- Base OSINT: 0.7
- CYBINT boost: +0.15
- SIGINT boost: +0.15
- Diversity bonus: +0.05
- **Result: 0.92 (HIGH confidence)**

### Example 2: Vulnerability-Threat Correlation

**Input:**
```json
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "id": "CVE-2024-12345",
    "cvss_score": 9.8,
    "severity": "critical"
  },
  "threat_intel": [
    {"source": "osint", "exploitation": true, "actor": "APT99"},
    {"source": "cybint", "poc_available": true},
    {"source": "osint", "actor": "FIN7", "exploitation": true}
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "confidence_label": "high",
  "risk_multiplier": 2.5,
  "recommendation": "URGENT: Patch immediately - Active exploitation confirmed"
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- CVE exists (CYBINT source: 0.9)
- 3 threat reports corroborate
- Active exploitation confirmed
- Multiple threat actors
- **Result: 0.95 (HIGH confidence) + URGENT priority**

### Example 3: Campaign Detection

```json
{
  "ioc_correlations": [
    {"ioc": "evil.com", "occurrence": 5, "confidence": 0.88}
  ],
